    "description": "The 83x optical zoom of the COOLPIX P950 covers an incredible focal-length range, from wide-angle 24mm1 to super-telephoto 2,000mm1 and everything in between. With a zoom this powerful, you can capture distant subjects far beyond the reach of an ordinary camera—from birds and other animals in the wild, to distant landscapes, aircraft and even planets. Dynamic Fine Zoom2, an enhanced digital zoom that effectively doubles the reach to a 4,000mm1, allowing for even greater zoom potential. At the other end of the spectrum, macro photography can be captured as close as approx. 1 cm/0.4 in.3. From macro close-ups to extreme telephoto superzoom , the COOLPIX P950 delivers sharp, clear and beautiful images, all in a compact, highly portable body."
